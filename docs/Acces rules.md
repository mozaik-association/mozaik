# Access rights

Each user in Odoo can be linked to general access rights (standard feature in Odoo) and to one or several internal instances (Mozaik feature). Every user in Mozaik can be linked to a certain level in the internal structure of the organisation or political party, which will grant the user access to more or less data in Odoo. 

    !!! example
    
        A user who is part of the 'highest' internal instance will have access to all contacts/events etc... of the organisation. A user who is linked to a 'low' internal instance (ex: a specific city) will only have access to the contacts / events etc... of this specific city.
        A user who is linked to a regional instance (ex: region of Brussels in Belgium) will have access to all the contacts / events etc... related to the region of Brussels and all the instances who are 'below' the region of Brussels in the internal structure of the organisation (ex: the contacts/events etc... from the 19 municipalities of Brussels who are part of the region of Brussels).

Most features of Mozaik are regulated by those specific access rules (ex: contacts, distribution lists, mass mailings, events, surveys, petitions, participations, mandates etc...).

# Sructure

The structure module allows you to create the organic structure of your country and  your political party. This module is a module that is configured only once, at the beginning of the use of Mozaik. Once the structure of your organisation is configured it is not necessary to touch it anymore, except in case of change of the ornasiation's structure. The information configured will be usefull in other modules (contacts, mandats...)

The structure module allows you to manage :

- The country structure
- The internal structure 
- The external structure 
All three categories work in the same way.

This module allows you to get acces to : 

- The instancies
- The assemblies
- The electoral districts
- The legislatures

## Instancies

You can create all the instances related to your state by giving a name a level of power. For each instance created you can give the parent instance of this instance. For example, the East flanders province is the parent instance of the commune of Ghent.

    - The police council
    - The social action council

# Distribution list module

As with the standard Odoo module that allows to create mailing lists, the Mozaik distribution list module allows to create distribution lists. Its advantage compared to the standard Odoo module is that it is much more complete and powerful. The module first allows you to create a distribution list. You have to give a name to this list and you can also write a free note to this list

## Include filtres

Within a distribution list, it is possible to add filters that will allow you to find a list of contacts that meet these filters that should be included in the distribution list.

# Sructure

The structure module allows you to create the organic structure of your country and  your political party. This module is a module that is configured only once, at the beginning of the use of Mozaik. Once the structure is configured it is not necessary to touch it anymore, except in case of change of the party structure. The informations configured in this module can then be reused in other module.

## State level

You can create all the instances related to your state. You can name the instances created and give them a power. For each instance created you can give the parent instance of this instance. For example, the federal instance will be the parent instance of the regional instance.
Each instance can be re-elected at meetings. For example, the national instance will have a House of Representatives - a Federal Government - a Senate.

## Interne level

The internal structure works in the same way as the state structure. The internal structure is composed of instances with levels of power. Each instance has several assemblies according to their level of power

# Sructure

The structure module allows you to create the organic structure of your country and  your political party. This module is a module that is configured only once, at the beginning of the use of Mozaik. Once the structure of your organisation is configured it is not necessary to touch it anymore, except in case of change of the ornasiation's structure. The informations configured will be usefull in other modules (contacts, mandats...)

The structure module is divided into 3 categories:

- The country structure
- Internal structure 
- External structure 
All three categories work in the same way 

This module allows you to get acces to : 

- The instancies
- The assemblies
- The electoral districts
- The legislatures

## The instancies

You can create all the instances related to your state. You can name the instances created and give them a power. For each instance created you can give the parent instance of this instance. For example, the East flanders province is the parent sinstance of the commune of Ghent.

## The assemblies

Categories of assemblies can be associated with each instance according to their level of power. 

!!!example

    The Ghent instance is associated with 4 categories of assemblies:

    - The town council
    - The college of mayors and aldermen 
    - The police council
    - The social action council

## Interne level

The internal structure works in the same way as the state structure. The internal structure is composed of instances with levels of power. Each instance has several assemblies according to their level of power.

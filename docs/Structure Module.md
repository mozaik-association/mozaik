#Sructure Module

The structure module allows you to create the organic structure of your country and  your political party. This module is a module that is configured only once, at the beginning of the use of Mozaik. Once the structure is configured it is not necessary to touch it anymore, except in case of change of the party structure. The information configured in this module can then be reused in other studies.
